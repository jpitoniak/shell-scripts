# shell-scripts

This repo contains a collection of shell scripts that I use to help manage my various (mostly Debian-based) Linux machines.  Feel free to use them for your own needs if you like.

The scripts are organized into directories by topic area and each directory contains a README with further instructions for using them.

This repo is not intended to be cloned to the machine to access the scripts.  Rather, the required scripts should be individually copied to each machine.  I typically place them in `/root/bin`, but they can be run from anywhere that makes sense.
